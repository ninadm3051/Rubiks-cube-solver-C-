# Rubiks-cube-solver-C++
•  Modeled a virtual Rubiks's Cube (3x3) in 3 different models/classes using standard data structures and algorithms in C++.

•  Achieved a solving time of under 3 seconds for a Rubiks's cube jumbled 8 times, using DFS, BFS and IDDFS algorithms.

•  Implemented the Korf's IDA* Algorithm, achieving a solving time of under 10 seconds for a Rubik's cube jumbled 13 times.
